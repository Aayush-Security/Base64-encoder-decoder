Graphical Base64 encoder and decoder
===================

A simple base64 encoder and decoder for files, written in python. 
Works as both a command-line utility and as a graphical application for those 
who have PyGTK available.

Takes a file (binary or text) as an input and encodes it to a base64 text file.
The reverse operation is also possible, by taking a text file and decoding it
back to the original format.
